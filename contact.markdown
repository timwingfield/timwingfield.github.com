##Contact Me 
I'll spare us all some annoying form to fill out followed by a captcha image that you've got a 50/50 chance of being able to decipher. If you're on this page, you're either a human being or you're not. If you're not, you've already scanned this page and not found a mailto link. If you are, there are two good ways to contact me.

I'm @timwingfield on twitter, hit me up there.

Need more than 140 characters? Feel free to mail me at tim AT timwingfield DOT com.
