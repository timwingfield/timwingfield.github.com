## Two Talks at Indy Code Camp

I am honored to have been selected to give not one, but two talks at the upcoming [Indy Code Camp](http://www.indycodecamp.org/) on May 16th.

I'll be presenting Care About Your Craft: Adventures in the Art of Software Development, and A Little Bit of Lean With Kanban. Both these talks are a lot of fun and get good audience participation, so it should be fun.

The Indy Code Camp is typically as much code as you can crank out, and they have a max of 3 slides request for most talks. But, I'm in Track Five: Beyond Lines of Code...which is a good thing, as both talks have way more than 3 slides, and 0 lines of code.
