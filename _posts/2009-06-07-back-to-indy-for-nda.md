## Back to Indy for NDA

A few weeks back, I made my first trip to speak in Indy at the [Indy Code Camp](http://www.indycodecamp.org/). I had a great time, met some new people, and got invited back to speak at [IndyNDA](http://indynda.org/) on ASP.Net MVC.

So, this Thursday, June 11, if youâ€™re in the greater Indianapolis metropolitan area and want to learn a little MVC, then I hope to see you at IndyNDA.
