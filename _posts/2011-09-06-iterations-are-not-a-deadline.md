##Iterations Are Not a Deadline

I have worked in iteration based systems for years. I have worked in one week and two week iterations. (I have heard tell of people doing iterations measured in months or quarters, which scares the bejeesus out of me.) I have also worked on teams where we have gotten rid of iterations all together because they did not make sense for our situation.  Those teams were Kanban teams and we valued continuous flow over the choppy stop, start, "slam QA on Thursday" that iterations can sometimes become.

At a recent conference I overheard a conversation between a colleague and an attendee.  The colleague in this case had just given a seminar on Kanban that this particular person had attended and had a few follow up questions. The first few questions were pretty mild, then it happened...

> _"How do you make Kanban work without the the pressure of the iteration to make your developers finish their work?"_

That one fired me up. I did not dive in the middle of the conversation red faced and shaking my finger in this way-too-obvious-project-manager's face. Instead, I did the next best thing, I [unleashed a strongly worded tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/timwingfield/status/78482338278948864).

###"We need that by, um, Friday"

The first issue here is we have no proof that a deadline forces a team to deliver anything.

no proof a deadline makes you deliver anything
 - ever moved a deadline?
 - fixed scope + fixed time frame = bad things even in one week
 - death march at PG -- hidden OT

Don't trust your team?
  - why work with them?
  - do you have the right team? junior is junior, they don't become senior in a week.
  Will get better but need time to do. Capacity of a team is a fixed, though slightly
  increasing number. There is no "type faster, we're on a deadline" button on a dev
  team.
  - are you "helping" them self organize?
  - do they feel "safe"?

Devs - why don't they trust you?
  - daily nerf war from 3 to 5?
  - missing features often?
  - "They think this is easy!"
  - communicating?

Solutions
  - use the iteration for its intended purpose: A Timebox
  - learn from it. ask "why" when things don't work AND when the do!
  - if devs are continually missing: stories too big? too many stories on the board per
  iteration?

Get some slack
  - team needs slack for refactoring
  - for innovation
  - to not hurry and make mistakes
  - to work together

Agile is about continuously learning, no matter what process you are using. You should
be learning more about your team, your product, and your problems every iteration. Every
day.

Agile Manifesto line four: "We value responding to change over following a plan."
Iteration deadline: plan or timebox?
