## Upcoming Speaking Events

Trying to slow down the speaking and associated travel schedule this year, but not giving up on it entirely. So, here's what I've got coming around the corner...

### Stir Trek

On May 6th, [Stir Trek](http://stirtrek.com/) happens again. This has quickly grown into one of the region's more popular conferences, and it's only a one day thing.

Yes, more of Tim yammering on and on (and on and on) about Kanban and how it will cure all that ails you, but this time I get to do that yammering in Vegas! I am really looking forward to this conference and the crowd that will be different from the normal developer type crowd at most of the conferences I attend.
