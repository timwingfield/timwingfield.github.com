## Rails Study Apps

I’m trying to pick up some rails in my spare time. Been plugging away at my pet project when I can, which leads to a lot of googling while I do it. If one of my known Rubyist friends is at a [Code and Coffee](http://www.codeandcoffee.info/) session, I spend a fair amount of time picking their brains and pairing up to learn what I can in an hour or so.

That all works pretty well, but at my pace I’ll be forever getting my Ruby code to look less like C# and more like Ruby. So, as [Steve blogged recently](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2009/11/18/reading-code-is-key-to-writing-good-code.aspx), why not find a few Rails apps to read? So, I hit up my twitter friends: [http://twitter.com/timwingfield/status/6464205602](http://twitter.com/timwingfield/status/6464205602)

I got three pretty good responses, and finally got time tonight to pull them down and take a quick look at them. I don’t have a lot of info on any of them, but I did browse the source to get a feel for what was going on.

### Radiant CMS

[http://github.com/radiant/radiant](http://github.com/radiant/radiant)

This one was recommended by [Dugald Wilson](http://twitter.com/dugaldwilson). Decent amount of code here to look at, and uses RSpec for the test framework. This one definitely fit the bill for what I was after.

### Spot.us

[http://github.com/spot-us/spot-us](http://github.com/spot-us/spot-us)

I got this one as a tag team recommendation from [Scott Walker](http://twitter.com/pragma_tech) and [Matt Darby](http://twitter.com/mattdarby). This is a non-profit company doing Community Funded Reporting and is coming from the folks at [Hashrocket](http://www.hashrocket.com/). More RSpec out of this project, and again a fair amount of code to pour over.

### Redmine

[http://github.com/edavis10/redmine](http://github.com/edavis10/redmine)

The third one came through [Ben Wagaman](http://twitter.com/jamin4jc). This one uses TestUnit instead of RSpec, but still some decent reading. I’m going to have to dig into the tests a bit more on this one, though, because the file names aren’t jumping out at me as model/controller/etc type tests. But, that’s the point of this exercise, to see what other folks are doing.

I’ve got a little flying and a lot of driving ahead of me this weekend, hopefully I get some time to dive deeper into what each of these apps is up to, and get some more Rails code under my belt.

If you’ve come across a few more open source Rails apps out there, please drop a link in the comments.
