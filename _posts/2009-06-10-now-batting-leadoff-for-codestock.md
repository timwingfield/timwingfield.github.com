## Now Batting Leadoff for CodeStock...

I am honored to have been selected to speak at [CodeStock](http://codestock.org/) and will be delivering having my Kanban conversation in the great state of Tennessee. I’m really looking forward to this as I didn’t make CodeStock last summer, and it looks like a great two day event. The good folks that have organized the conference have slotted me in one of the opening sessions on Friday, so we’ll get our Lean on early in the conference.

There are a number of sessions I’m looking forward to, and since mine is over early I should get to a bunch of them. But, as with any regional conference, I’m looking forward to the hallway sessions as well.

If you’re thinking about going, go get registered, it looks like it’s going to be a good time.
