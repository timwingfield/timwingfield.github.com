## Presenting in Findlay this Tuesday

I can’t believe I didn’t get this blogged sooner: I’m presenting “Care About Your Craft: Adventures in the Art of Software Development” in Findlay this coming Tuesday, May 19th.

I’m looking forward to heading up to Findlay for this. I met a few of the [FANUG](http://fanug.org/default.aspx) guys at Indy Code Camp this weekend, so I’ve got a few hecklers already primed.
