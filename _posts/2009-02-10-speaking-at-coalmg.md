## Speaking at COALMG

I have been selected to present on [Kanban to the Central Ohio ALM Group](http://www.coalmg.org/2009/02/march-meeting-announcement-little-bit.html) on March 5th. This will kick off my 2009 speaking tour, and I get to open it with a new talk on Kanban. I'm really looking forward to this talk because I've seen the advantages of Kanban first hand.

So, if you want to learn a little about Kanban, what it is, and how to get started with it...or if you just want to heckle me...drop by the Microsoft offices on Polaris Pkwy March 5th.
