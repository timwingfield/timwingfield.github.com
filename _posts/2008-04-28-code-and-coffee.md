## Code and Coffee

After a great day at [Kalamazoo X](http://kalamazoox.org/), and a conversation with [Mike Wood](http://mvwood.com/) about his Bitslinger idea in Cincy. [Jeff](http://www.jeffblankenburg.com/) and I had a few hours in the truck headed south to work out something for Columbus, so [Code and Coffee](http://codeandcoffee.info/) was born.

OK, we hatched the general ideaâ€¦meet at a coffee shop on Thursday mornings, write code. I came up with the name and bought the domain. :)

The idea is straight forward: Show up at our coffee shop of choice, bring a laptop, pair up, and have fun writing some code.
