## CODoDN Follow-up

First, big thanks to everybody that attended my talk on Kanban at [Central Ohio Day of .Net](http://cinnug.org/cododn/). It was a lot of fun talking with everybody, no matter how many times I got side tracked.

The first request from the talk was a link to [Corey Ladas](http://leansoftwareengineering.com/) blog. Corey has some great stuff in there, but start with the [scrumban](http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/) post.

Here are [my slides](https://github.com/timwingfield/SlideDecks/blob/master/Codestock.2010/LittleLeanWithKanban.pdf). The slides themselves are just to support the talk, but there are notes on each slide.
