## IronRuby at CONDG

Off the top, apologies for the rather dark color scheme. The slides I think I can change the contrast on a little and they’ll be fine, but I know better than to use a dark color scheme for my ide and/or text editor. I guess the editing of the config file in Rails was just all black, sorry about that. (On the config side, you didn’t miss much, though.)

HOWEVER! :) 

I just uploaded a PDF of the slides and you can look at them in whatever color scheme really makes them pop! You can get it all here: [http://github.com/timwingfield/TestingSeaPound/tree/CONDG](http://github.com/timwingfield/TestingSeaPound/tree/CONDG)

Not a total cop out, please take a look at the code sample if you want to see the complete test classes from the examples - both the nUnit and RSpec ones. The rails app uploaded is the same one I created in the presentation, complete with the poorly named controller.

Again, sorry for the dark background in places, but thanks for coming out to watch.

(And big thanks to [Kruger](http://jonkruger.com/blog/2010/07/22/slides-from-my-productivity-boosters-talk-at-condg/) for making me remember how much I miss AutoHotKey after moving to the Mac. Windows devs, download AutoHotKey as soon as you read this.)
