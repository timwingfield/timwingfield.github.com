## The Summer Tour of Timbo

The summer speaking tour is about to get underway, fresh off the heels of my successful spring tour. (Successful after the QSI Tech Night unit-test-a-palooza fun.)

We'll be kicking off the summer tour in Cincinnati next Tuesday (6/24) at the June [CINNUG](http://cinnug.org/) meeting. I'll be presenting on the ASP.Net MVC framework, why it's cool, why you should be using it now, and how it will do simple household chores for you - walking the dog, doing the laundry, and cleaning the bathroom. (It doesn't do windows, though.)

Fresh off the evening in Cincinnati, I'll be heading to Dayton the very next evening to present the same riveting and engaging presentation to the good people of the [Dayton .Net Developers Group](http://daytondevgroup.net/). Fellow Quickie [Jim Holmes](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/) helps run the Dayton bunch, so I expect heckling in Dayton.

Following the quick bang-bang trip across south western Ohio, I'm off for a few weeks before I head below the Mason-Dixon line to speak to the [Memphis .Net User Group](http://memphisdot.net/) on July 24. "Memphis?!?!" you saying. [Jeff](http://www.jeffblankenburg.com/index.html) introduced me to [Colin Neller](http://www.colinneller.com/blog/), president of MNUG, when I was in Vegas for Mix, and he invited me down after I expressed a little interest in getting out to do some speaking. My topic in Memphis is as yet undecided. Colin has a poll up in the MNUG forums for either an MVC deep dive or my Evangelizing the Pragmatic Programmer talk. Can't wait to see the results. It's 50/50 at the moment, so if you're in the Memphis area get your vote in...you could be the deciding vote!

That ends my scheduled trips at the moment, who knows what I'll rope myself into as August comes along.
