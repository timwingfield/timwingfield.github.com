## Indy Code Camp Recap

For the first time in my short speaking career, I stepped over my imaginary Microsoft Line and out to another region…alllll the way to Indianapolis. I’ve driven to Memphis to talk, and stay in my region, but never the whopping 3 1/2 hour drive to Indy to see the good folks over there. After this trip, I think I’ll step over the imaginary line a few more times.

First, a big thanks to [Dave Leininger](http://twitter.com/DaveLeininger) for putting on a great event. There were over 200 people at the event, and it seemed all were enjoying themselves. Dave drew speakers from 5 states for the Indy Code Camp, so tip of the hat for getting the word out.

The hallway sessions are always good, but I missed out on a few running [Jeff](http://twitter.com/jblankenburg) to the airport and back. (And not finding the airport right away didn’t help.) But even with my limited hallway track time, I still met some new folks and talked shop with some familiar faces.

I’m already looking forward to my next foray over the imaginary line that is the western border of Ohio. (Maybe a trip east is in order? :) )
